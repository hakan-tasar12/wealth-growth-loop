# Compound Growth Engine

This is a Python-based financial tool built as part of the **Angela Yu 100 Days of Code Bootcamp**. The project focuses on simulating how money accumulates over time through compound interest, applying fundamental programming concepts to real-world finance.

## 📌 Project Concept
Understanding the time value of money is essential in finance. I designed this simulation to calculate how long it takes to reach a specific financial goal. It uses an iterative logic where the calculation repeats until the target amount is achieved.

## 🛠 Technical Features
* **Iterative Logic:** Uses a `while` loop to handle calculations where the number of cycles depends on user-defined goals.
* **Dynamic Inputs:** The script accepts custom values for starting capital, annual interest rates, and final targets.
* **Professional Formatting:** Outputs are displayed as currency with proper decimal precision and separators.
* **Simulation Flow:** Includes a controlled output delay to visualize year-by-year growth.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
2. Download the `main.py` file.
3. Run the script in your terminal:
   ```bash
   python main.py
